# My Approach to the Take-Home Assignment

When I received the take-home assignment, I started by breaking down the task into its three main components:

1. **Manual Testing**  
2. **Android Automation**  
3. **API Automation**

To stay organized and maintain visibility into my progress, I created a **Notion board** structured like a Kanban board, with columns for _To-Do_, _In Progress_, and _Done_. I also introduced **swimlanes** for each of the three project areas to compartmentalize the work effectively. Then, I populated the board with all the tasks I anticipated, based on my understanding of the requirements. Similar to sprint planning, I estimated approximate timelines for each task to help manage my time efficiently.

## Day 1: Exploration and Manual Testing

I dedicated the first day to understanding the app and the scope of work. I began by **exploring the Monify Android app manually**, identifying core functionalities and potential test cases. In parallel, I researched **Android automation frameworks** and options for **API testing**, to begin shaping the tools and frameworks I’d use moving forward.

## Android Automation

Initially, I considered using **Appium** for Android automation. However, I encountered setup issues with it on my local environment. Given my past experience with native Android testing frameworks, I pivoted to using the **native Android testing stack** instead. This allowed me to move forward more efficiently and maintain confidence in the quality of my tests.

## API Automation

For API testing, I evaluated a few different tools and languages. Although I have a background in **Python**, I ultimately chose **Rest Assured** for the assignment. This decision was guided both by its robustness and the fact that it aligns with N26’s own tech stack. This was a great opportunity for me to reinforce and expand my knowledge of Rest Assured.

## Workflow and Delivery

Throughout the project, I kept myself accountable using the Notion board, which served as both a project tracker and a self-imposed deadline manager. Once I had completed a **proof of concept for each section**, I structured my work into a clean **GitHub repository**, adding clear documentation and examples. This ensured the submission was not only functional but also easy to navigate and review.
